# README

An instagram-like application. Idea is that there is a normal 'wall'. And then another page where users can 'battle' other players. For example, two people post images of their cars and other users vote them up/down.

Current functionality:
-Models are completed
-Login/logout functionality works. Go to /access/login and user name is 'test' password is 'testpassword'.
-Uploading images to S3 nearly done (running into some strange errors on AWS).
-Uses bootstrap
